# HTML + CSS website

This Repository contains the code for my second website as I learn to use html, css, and javascript. At the present moment it uses html, and css however as I learn to use more javascript the website will be updated. You can access the website using this link https://talaaltahir.github.io/css-cv/ , or downloading the files and opening it on your local device. If you have any questions you can contact me through the website.
